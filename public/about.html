    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
<p>I am a dynamic and proactive professional with a diverse background spanning construction management, IT 
    operations, and software development. My journey has been one of constant learning and evolution, starting from 
    managing multimillion-pound construction projects to now diving deep into the world of software engineering. Each 
    step in my career has been driven by a passion for problem-solving and a commitment to delivering high-quality 
    results, whether on a construction site or within a tech environment.</p>

<p>Recently, I have transitioned into software development, leveraging my technical acumen and project management 
    skills. I hold a first-class Bachelor's degree in Digital Technology and Solutions from Roehampton University, 
    which provided me with a solid foundation in IT. During my studies, I developed various applications, including 
    a Python-based employee management system and a PowerApp to improve user interactions. These projects reflect my
    ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical, innovative solutions.</p>

<p>In my most recent role as an IT Operations Support Analyst at CAE Technology Services Ltd, I took on the challenge
    of learning PowerFX and the Power Platform independently, ultimately developing an asset tracker that saved the
    company tens of thousands of pounds. My dedication to continuous improvement and my ability to adapt quickly to
    new technologies have been key to my success.</p>

<p>
  I am now focused on advancing my career in software development. I have completed courses in Laravel and Responsive
   Web Design and am proficient in HTML, CSS, PHP, and Python. I am excited to bring my unique blend of experience, 
   technical skills, and enthusiasm to a dynamic team, where I can continue to grow and contribute to impactful 
   projects.
